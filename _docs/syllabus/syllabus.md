## What is this course about? 
Data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are making inroads into many aspects of society, with numerous impacts across disparate disciplines with often surprising applications.  The ability to understand the capabilities and limitations of these technologies and use them in an appropriate manner is already an important skill and is projected to be increasingly important in the future.  The goal of this course is to provide an applied introduction to current techniques in machine learning and how they can be used to make sense of large amounts of data, while allowing students to focus on how machine learning is impacting their discipline of study. 
 
Towards this end, this course will introduce concepts from data science and machine learning through two distinct pathways. First, all students will be required to finish the Duke Coursera Course “Introduction to Machine Learning.” This course can be accessed through Coursera at Duke (https://plus.datascience.duke.edu/learn-ds), which will allow students to enroll for free. Second, students can choose from a variety of offered “In-Person Learning Experiences” (IPLEs) offered through the +Data Science initiative.  Every student is required to attend at least 4 sessions in person. The schedule is maintained at https://plus.datascience.duke.edu/. Finally, to make this course relevant to your own field of study, each student has to complete a project where they apply machine learning techniques to data relevant to their discipline.  Some example datasets and tasks will be provided, but students will be encouraged to propose their own relevant project.  Students will present the projects publicly at the end of the semester. 
 
Classes are scheduled on Monday from 4:40-6:10PM in Gross Hall, Room 330. Note that while there are no formal prerequisites for this course, there will be assumptions on the background of the students described below. Most critically, a background in a programming language will be assumed, and Python will be employed in the course. 
 

## What learning paths may I choose from? 
This course is split into two learning paths: The Humanities +DS and Social Sciences +DS path and the Science and Engineering +DS and Medicine +DS path. These two tracks have the same overall structure and deadlines for deliverables, but will vary in the type of projects performed.  Matthew Kenney will direct Humanities +DS and Social Sciences +DS path, and both David Carlson and Matthew Engelhard will direct the Science and Engineering +DS and Medicine +DS path. 

## What is the Humanities +DS and Social Sciences +DS path? 
The Humanities +DS and Social Sciences +DS path focuses on deep learning for the Digital Humanities and Social Sciences. Throughout the semester, students will work hands-on with state-of-the-art models for image analysis, text classification, and image and text generation amongst other topics. We will explore how to fine-tune these AI models for specific tasks, and how these tasks can be applied to our personal research interests and for creative and expressive purposes.  

## What is the Science and Engineering +DS and Medicine +DS path? 
The Science and Engineering +DS and Medicine +DS path focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence to learn from big data to automate tasks, improve predictive outcomes, and make new scientific discoveries.  Throughout the semester, students will work hands-on with state-of-the-art neural networks, including modern convolutional and recurrent neural networks.  We will explore how these networks can be employed and learned from data to help with these above tasks and can be applied to our personal research interests. Students will either be able to apply methods to their own proposed project, or adapt some suggested projects on real-world data. 

## May I audit or sit in on this course? 
No, due to the nature of this course audits are not appropriate. 

## What background knowledge do I need before taking this course? 
The course will assume that the students are comfortable with introductory material in probability & statistics and basic coding in a scripting language (e.g. Python, R, Matlab). 
 
Example codes for the online material and anything additional provided will be written in Python using the PyTorch.  Code will be required along with the write-up for the final project, and will be accepted written in Python, Matlab, or R.  Use of notebooks (i.e., Jupyter or R-markdown) is highly recommended. 
 
If you are uncertain about your background, please reach out to an instructor.  There are many online resources that cover the necessary background that can help get you up to speed. 

## What required texts, materials, and equipment will I need? 
There is no required book for this course, however there are many recommended resources. 
 
A recommended optional text is Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville, First Edition. [It is freely available online through](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) 
 
A second recommended optional text is The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, Second Edition.  This book is freely available to students in an electronic version to Duke students at the time of writing this syllabus. 
 
For hands-on examples of machine learning in practice: 

*  [Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning by Ian Pointer](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-pytorch-for/9781492045342/). 
*  [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists by Müller and Guido.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/)  
*  [Natural Language Processing wih PyTorch](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920063445.do) 
 
The use of an appropriate coding environment will be required.  This can either be done on a student’s local machine (recommended) or by using an online resource.  Many online resources exist, including local resources provided by Duke University and resources such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).  

## What will I learn in this course? 
At the conclusion of the course, the student will be able to…<br>
…determine appropriate analyses for different data types and scientific questions<br>
…critique data-based claims and evaluate data-based decisions<br>
…communicate machine learning results correctly, effectively, and in context 
without relying on statistical jargon<br> 
 
## What will I learn in the Humanities +DS and Social Sciences +DS track? 
At the conclusion of the course, the student will be able to…<br>
…apply creative approaches to machine learning problems<br> 
… develop an applied understanding of machine learning and deep learning practice<br> 
… create and fine-tune natural language processing models that can be used on an array of social science and digital humanities tasks<br> 
… communicate machine learning application and results effectively<br> 


 
## How will these objectives be assessed and my grade calculated?  
 Coursera Course Completion: By 2/24/20, a certificate with the final grade achieved in the online course needs to be provided. Students are expected to receive a passing grade for the Coursera course.
 
Project: A major point of this course is to demonstrate that you can apply the learned material to a problem of your choice.  The project will be broken up into 4 discrete assignments, all of which will be provided significant additional guidance. 

1. 	**Proposal**: A brief outline of the planned work.  This is a very valuable document that will allow the teaching team to assess the appropriateness of the project. The feedback will be making sure that there is a crisp, precise goal that is of an appropriate scope.  This means both that it isn’t a trivial problem, but also that the scope is not too large. Projected due date of 3/2/20. 
2. 	**Progress Report**: A document outlining the progress to date, allowing feedback and constructive criticism on the current status of the project. Projected due date of 3/30/20. 
3. 	**Final Report**: A document outlining the completed project. Projected due date of 4/20/20 (last day of undergraduate classes). 
4. 	**Presentation**: The students will present and disseminate the methods and results of their projects. A poster and presentation session will be held on Monday 4/27/20, from 2-5pm


## Project Grading Breakdown:
* Coursera Course Completion: 10%
* Project Proposal: 20%
* Project Progress Report: 20%
* Project Final Report: 40%
* IPLE Quizzes: 10%
 
## Attendance: 
Students must attend 4 IPLE’s throughout the semester. Weekly class attendance is strongly encouraged. A student is required to get a passing grade on IPLE quizzes. If the quizzes is failed, then another IPLE must be taken to satisfy the requirement. 

## Makeup Assignments
In the event that students cannot make 4 IPLE's throughout the semester, students can complete a makeup assignment. The makeup assignment consists of watching 1 tutorial provided by the professor, and completing a 2 page summary of the tutorials main points. Tutorials are pulled from past NeurIPS Conference Tutorials and are typically ~2hrs long. Please see Matthew Kenney for links to appropriate tutorials. 

## What will be expected from the final project?  
The final project will be a group project to demonstrate your mastery of the course concepts. An important note is that the project will not be graded on the performance metrics obtained by the approach. Instead, the project will be graded on whether the project was approached correctly, and whether the analysis and conclusions make sense in the context of the class. Therefore, you do not have to choose a task that you know you can be successful on, and you are encouraged to explore a topic of interest to you. Each group should have 3-4 students, but individuals or pairs of students can apply to work more independently from the instructors. Because there will be slightly different expectations between the depth of project needed for undergraduates versus graduate students, each team should be fully undergraduates or graduates and be focused on the same track. The student’s track only has to be finalized when the project proposal is submitted.
 
## What additional texts or resources might be helpful?  
There are numerous online resources available.  Students may find the course lectures on Coursera useful as an additional resource, and those courses are free to audit.  Some relevant background coursework includes: 

* Data Science Math Skills: 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills 
 
* Statistics Background: 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro 
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics 
 
 
Additionally, there are many additional online resources that can provide alternative explanations to my own, including: 
* Data Science in Python: 
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python 
 
* Data Science in R: 
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science 
 
There are numerous reference books that may be of relevance (many of which can be found at the Duke Library or are freely available online), including but not limited to: 
 
* The Elements of Statistical Learning. Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 
* Pattern Classification. Duda, Hart, and Stork 
* Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Bishop 
* Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques. Izenman 
* An Introduction to Statistical Learning. James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani 
* Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective. Murphy 
* Deep Learning. Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville. 
 
Hands-on books have typically been helpful to students in getting the algorithms going in code and on their own projects. 


## What are the course policies?  
Students are expected to follow the [Duke Community Standard (DCS)](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard), which will be affirmed on every assignment.  While many actions are clearly violations of the DCS, you may encounter situations where whether or not an action would be considered a violation of the DCS is not entirely clear to you. A guiding principle is, if you wouldn’t want anyone, or everyone, to know you did it, then don’t do it. If you are unsure whether an action would be considered a violation of the DCS, please talk with an instructor before you do it.  Cheating will not be tolerated and will immediately be brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities. 
 
Late report submissions will be accepted for credit up to 3 days after the deadline with the following penalties.

* 1 day late=5% penalty 
* 2 days late=10% penalty 
* 3 days late=20% penalty 

Note that all assignments must be completed and turned in.  If a student does not complete and turn in an assignment (even for 0 credit), the final grade will be an incomplete. 
 
Given the nature of this course, re-grades are unlikely.  However, reports will be graded with the benefit of the doubt in mind. If you request a re-grade, the entire problem document or exam will be re-graded, and it is possible to lose points. You are advised to only request a re-grade if an obvious mistake in grading was made. Please note that besides tabulation errors, re-grades have typically, but not always, resulted in lower grades. To request a re-grade, send an email to Matthew Kenney with a brief description of the issue (<4 sentences). After 1 week of return, no re-grades will be considered. 
 
## What is the expected course schedule? 
The only formal deadlines are those for the project. Students should plan to complete the Coursera material as quickly as possible to provide background and motivation for their project.
