# Intro
An important part of software development is setting up your environment with the correct software versions. As this is the first week and we’re all working on different computers, creating a similar environment will allow us to collaborate and share ideas and reduce confusion. There are a few things that we’ll need to get set up before we dive into developing our first projects.

1. A text editor
2. A fresh python install 
3. Jupyter Notebooks install
4. A GitHub account and proper git install
5. PyTorch installation


### A Text Editor
In this class, I'll let you use whatever text editor you feel most comfortable with. Here is a list of popular text editors from least to most advanced:

* [Visual Studio Code (easy)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom (easy)](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text (easy)](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Text Mate (medium)](https://macromates.com/)
* [MacVim (advanced)](http://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/)
* [Vim (advanced)](http://www.vim.org/)
* [Emacs (advanced)](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

Download one of the text editors listed above (I'll be using Visual Code for the remainder of the course).

### A Fresh Python Install
We'll be using Python for the majority of this course. Having python installed correctly is crucial to getting started. While most of are work will be on GPUs, we'll typically want to code and debug locally. We'll be using Anaconda to ensure that environments are similar across our personal laptops.
  
  * Task: Navigate to [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) and download and install the latest anaconda package for python 3.7.


### Jupyter Notebooks
We'll also want to use Jupyter Notebook for our coding. Jupyter Notebooks works similarly to text editors with a couple of nice features that will help us develop our networks. Namely, they allow us to see the output of the code that we run as we run it, allow us to quickly switch between environments, and clearly document our code in markdown. Jupyter Notebooks are used by ML researchers as a great way to organize code and keep track of experiments. Jupyter notebooks come preinstalled with Anaconda

  * Task: Navigate to [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/documentation) to view the documentation. Ensure that Jupyter Notebook is, in fact, included in your Anaconda envelope.

### A Github Account
Github is a place to store and keep track of code and is an important tool for anyone developing machine learning projects. It allows developers to keep track of versions of their work, create new versions (branches) to try out new ideas, and share code among a team. It’s also a social network to connect with other developers and collaborate on projects. For an overview of how to use GitHub, please see [this tutorial](http://aiforeveryone.net/tutorials/intro-to-git/)
  
  * Task: Install Git. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * Task: Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account. 
  * Task: Add yourself to the github group

### Install PyTorch
Well be working with PyTorch throughout this semster. We'll need to install the PyTorch library into our conda env.
  
  * Task: Navigate to [PyTorch - Getting Started Locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), and install the library.
